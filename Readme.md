# SmartEstimator

This is a machine learning POC I did for a client at Infogain. I trained a model that can predict the parts of car that needs to be repaired/replaced, when a car accident takes place, based on features such as point of impact, speed, fluid leaks, vehicle year make model etc.

The actual implementation and training of machine learning model has been done in azureml (microsoft machine learning platform). This code just provides an interface to the trained model.

## Getting Started

This is a simple web application that can be opened and run in Visual Studio 2015. Simply open the following solution file
